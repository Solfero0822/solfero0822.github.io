Namaste!üôè My journey began with the appriciatation of music performance, dragging me toward learning the piano. With time the practice sessions became a means to record my pieces into DAW's to critically analyze ‚Äî gradually sparking my curiosity into the technology, "How is able to record and playback the nuances of the playing?". Growing passion about music, audio, and technology. I build tools that make audio creation more expressive and accessible!

The software side, things that interests me are music information retrieval, deep learning and prototyping systems.
Contrary to that, acoutics/psycoacoutics, human interface devices and recording technologies still gets me to dive deeper.

### More about what I like...r

These are thing on the side that keeps me calm, patient and relaxed while forcees me to be detail oriented, problem solving and present.

Since childhood, the Japanese art of paper folding ‚Äî [Orgiami](./assets/ORIGAMI.md) has been the go to while striving away from screens. From as basic as the Traditional Crane to intermediate Kusudama Ball to 3-dimensional figures till Tessellation Models ‚Äî evoking patience, eye for detail and embrace flaws.

As a teenager, the adrenaline rushes from video games is unparallel ‚Äî being compatitive shooters with each pixel on Rainbow Six Siege, Valorant and Spectre Divide to completing stealth missions on Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, Wildlands and Breakpoint along with the motorsport games like Assetto Corsa and CarXdrift ‚Äî is a long list consisting various geners of games ‚Äî requested me to be present and take quick decisions to flip the situation around.

I am always open to talk about [Photography](./assets/PHOTOGRAPHY.md), Chess and Science.
