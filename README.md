Hi!ðŸ‘‹ My journey began with a passion for music and storytelling through sound. That curiosity led me to explore how technology can reshape the way we create, manipulate, and experience audio.

I focus on designing and developing audio tools and systemsâ€”ranging from intelligent mixing assistants and real-time processing frameworks to interactive sound installations and recording workflows. My work aims to make audio technology more expressive, accessible, and empowering for artists, engineers, and creative technologists.

Iâ€™m excited to contribute to the evolving future of audio by building systems that support new forms of creativity and collaboration.My journey began with a passion for music and storytelling through sound.

## Audio Software Engineering Projects

### Effects Processor Audio Plugin Software

_Developed a multi-effects audio plugin in C++ using the JUCE framework, incorporating classic audio effects like phaser, chorus, overdrive, and filters, with a modular signal chain for customizable routing. The plugin features an interactive UI with real-time parameter control, allowing users to adjust depth, rate, and feedback for a personalized audio experience._

### Algorithmic Mixing Assistant Software (Graduate Thesis)

_Developed standalone software for music mixing in Python using PyTorch, integrated a neural network based audio source separation model (UMXL) by Open-Unmix, extracted key features such as LUFS, Dynamic Range and Panning with Librosa. Visualizing the audio file as spectrogram with the help of Matplotlib and designed the user interface with CustomTkinter. Currently exploring real-time processing in C++ and ONNX realtime_
