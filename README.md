Hi!ðŸ‘‹ My journey began with a passion for music and storytelling through sound. That curiosity led me to explore how technology can reshape the way we create, manipulate, and experience audio.

I focus on designing and developing audio tools and systemsâ€”ranging from intelligent mixing assistants and real-time processing frameworks to interactive sound installations and recording workflows. My work aims to make audio technology more expressive, accessible, and empowering for artists, engineers, and creative technologists.

Iâ€™m excited to contribute to the evolving future of audio by building systems that support new forms of creativity and collaboration.My journey began with a passion for music and storytelling through sound.
